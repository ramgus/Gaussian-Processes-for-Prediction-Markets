# Gaussian-Processes-for-Prediction-Markets

The ability to accurately judge the probability of uncertain events is a crucial skill for humans to navigate the world. However, research by Tversky and Kahneman has shown that when faced with uncertainty, humans often rely on error-prone heuristics rather than optimal statistical principles. In this study, we aim to explore whether human judgments about the probability of future events in prediction markets are congruent with the optimal statistical inferences generated by Bayesian models. To do this, we will leverage data from Kalshi, an event contracts prediction market, and compare the spread between the bid and ask prices to the predictions of a Bayesian model using Gaussian Processes to forecast time-series data. By testing the accuracy of human judgment against the optimal statistical principles of Bayesian inference, we hope to gain a better understanding of how humans make decisions under uncertainty.
